Selection Sort: Imagine youâ€™re picking teams. 
You look at everyone, find the shortest person, and place them first. 
Then you look at the rest, find the next shortest, and place them second. 
You keep repeating until everyone is lined up by height.

ðŸ‘‰ It always looks for the smallest (or largest) in the unsorted group and puts it in the correct spot.
